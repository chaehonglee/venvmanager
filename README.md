# VenvManager

VenvManager is a Python virtual environment version manager designed to streamline the management of multiple virtual environments. It allows users to create, activate, list, delete, and export dependencies of virtual environments efficiently. This code and readme was entirely generated by gpt-4 and was tested by human developer to test the usability.

## Features

- **Initialize Environments**: Create new virtual environments with specified dependencies.
- **Activate Environments**: Easily switch between different environments.
- **List Environments**: View all available virtual environments.
- **Delete Environments**: Remove unused virtual environments.
- **Export Dependencies**: Export the dependencies of an environment to a requirements file.

## Installation

### Using pip

You can install VenvManager directly from the source using pip.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd venvmanager
    ```

2. Install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

### Using Setup Script

Alternatively, you can use the setup script to install VenvManager.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd venvmanager
    ```

2. Install the package:

    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```

## Usage

VenvManager provides several commands to manage your virtual environments. Below is a guide on how to use these commands.

### Initialize a New Environment

Create a new virtual environment. You can optionally provide a path to a requirements file to install dependencies.

```bash
venvmanager init <version_name> [-r <requirements_file>]
```

- `<version_name>`: The name of the environment to create.
- `-r <requirements_file>`: (Optional) Path to a requirements file.

### Activate an Environment

Activate an existing virtual environment. Note that this command will print instructions for manually sourcing the activation script.

```bash
venvmanager use <version_name>
```

- `<version_name>`: The name of the environment to activate.

### List All Environments

List all available virtual environments.

```bash
venvmanager list
```

### Delete an Environment

Delete an existing virtual environment.

```bash
venvmanager delete <version_name>
```

- `<version_name>`: The name of the environment to delete.

### Export Environment Dependencies

Export the dependencies of an environment to a requirements file.

```bash
venvmanager export <version_name> <file_path>
```

- `<version_name>`: The name of the environment to export.
- `<file_path>`: The file path to export the dependencies.


## Example Workflow

1. **Initialize a New Environment**:

    ```bash
    venvmanager init exp-llama-1 -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Activate the Environment**:

    ```bash
    venvmanager use exp-llama-1
    ```

    Follow the printed instructions to source the activation script in your shell:

    ```bash
    source .venvmanager/exp-llama-1/bin/activate
    ```

3. **List All Environments**:

    ```bash
    venvmanager list
    ```

4. **Delete an Environment**:

    ```bash
    venvmanager delete exp-llama-1
    ```

5. **Export Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    venvmanager export exp-llama-1 requirements.txt
    ```
